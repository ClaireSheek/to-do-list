// Dummy-Data-To-Do Homework:
// **DONE**Create a list of todos using the 200 todos retrieved from JSON Placeholder.
// **DONE**Should have minimum three buttons:
// **DONE**Fetch Todos - sends request for data
// **DONE**Log Todos - Logs the todos to the console
// **DONE**Populate Todos - lists all of the todos for the user to see in the window.
// **DONE**Make the text appear red if the completed property equals false. Set it to another color if it equals true.
// **DONE**Center and style your todo list.

// Push Yourself Further:
// **DONE**Only display 20 todos at a time. 
// **DONE**Create a button for each item that would mark it as done.
// Connect that "done" button to a function that uses this to change its completed property to true.
// Read the JSON Placeholder API to see if you can build an image gallery using their dummy images!

// To-Do-Filtering Homework:
// **DONE**Create and clone a new repo called: "Todo-Filtering".
// **DONE**Fetch the same data.
// **DONE**Store the data in a variable.
// **DONE**Add an input to take in a number from 1 - 10
// Add a button that when clicked will:
// **DONE**Clear the previous todos
// **Populate it with only todos with the userID that matches the number inputted
// Store the currently filtered todos in a variable
// So that you can create two more buttons that when clicked:
// Removes those todos
// Shows only todos that are either:
// completed
// not completed
// HINT 1: Copy/paste your code from last class to get started faster.

// HINT 2: When you're removing and repopulating, remember that you're removing them from the DOM and not the array.

// HINT 3: Take these tasks one at a time.

// Push Yourself Further
// Build another column for Complete todos.
// Sort the todos on just one click,
// Show only the selected userID's todos
// Display the Completed todos in one column
// Display the incomplete todos in another
// Annotate
